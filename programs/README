*** Initials ***
I drew my initials with triangles and triangle fans. My first initial, K, was made with 4 triangles, 2 of which were used to make the upper and lower parts of the K, and 2 of which were used to create negative space within the upper and lower triangle of the K. The second initial, M, was made with 2 triangle fans, once again with the first fan creating the general shape of the M and the second fan creating the negative space within the M.

My html file is called Initials_KM.html and my js file is called Initials_KM.js. These rely on the files within the Common folder.

*** Pong ***
I drew the ball with 12 triangles in a triangle fan, and the paddle with 2 triangles in a triangle strip. All of the initial values of the vertices for these shapes were stored in an array of vec2s called vertices with one vertex buffer object called bufferId. The x and y velocities are generated randomly using the Math.random() function. The current offset of the ball from its initial position is stored in ballx and bally, which are incremented each time it runs the render function in the js file, and the current offset of the paddle from its initial position is stored in paddlex, which is incremented when the left and right buttons are clicked. These offsets are loaded into a vec2 offset variable, which is passed using the uniform2fv() function to the HTML file to update the postition. This offset is first set to ball's offsets, then the ball is drawn, then the offset is set to the paddle's offsets, then the paddle is drawn. In order to determine whether the game has ended and to increment the bounce count, the ball's and paddles's position are checked in if statements in the render function in the js file.
