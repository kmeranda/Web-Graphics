I drew my initials with triangles and triangle fans. My first initial, K, was made with 4 triangles, 2 of which were used to make the upper and lower parts of the K, and 2 of which were used to create negative space within the upper and lower triangle of the K. The second initial, M, was made with 2 triangle fans, once again with the first fan creating the general shape of the M and the second fan creating the negative space within the M.

My html file is called HW1_KM.html and my js file is called HW1_KM.js. These rely on the files within the Common folder.
